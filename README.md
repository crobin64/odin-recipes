# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes was the perfect project to show that The Odin Project has taught me so much already! This project summed up everything that has been taught so far and included enough reptitions to really help it stick. Hiccups along the way, especially arround commiting and pushing, but I was able to find the answers I needed through the Discord channel and other Odin resources.
